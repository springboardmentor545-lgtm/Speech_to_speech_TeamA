### Azure Speech-to-Text Data Collection and Transcription

## 🎯 Objective
Set up Azure Speech-to-Text for real-time and batch transcription.  
Collect bilingual (English + Hindi) commentary-style recordings and store transcripts for later use in translation and preprocessing.

## Milestone 2
### Azure Translator Integration
## 🎯 Objective

Integrate the Azure Translator Text API with the existing Speech-to-Text module to automatically translate transcribed speech data into multiple languages.
